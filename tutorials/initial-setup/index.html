    <h3>Ticket Categories</h3>
</div>

<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>When you create an Event, you can set a sale period for each Ticket Category.
        This make sense especially for paid events like conferences, where you usually buy "Blind Bird", "Early Bird", "Full Price" tickets.
        You can define the sale period by defining the category Validity Range.</li>
    <li>If you want to set a validity date for the tickets (and not for the category),
        you can do that by editing the "Advanced Options" for the category and set
        <i>Custom ticket validity</i> (will be displayed in ticket PDF, email and calendar invitation).
    </li>
</ul>

<div class="page-header" id="configure-app">
    <h3>Stripe</h3>
</div>

<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>The <i>Stripe's secret key</i> and <i>Stripe's public key</i> can be found <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys">on your Stripe Dashboard</a>.</li>
    <li>The <i>Stripe Connect Client ID</i>, <i>Stripe Connect Callback URL</i> &amp; <i>Stripe Connect WebHook signature key</i>
        are only used when platform mode" has been activated, and the instance owner wants to collect fees from the organizers, and can just be left empty otherwise.</li>
